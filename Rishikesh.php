    <p>Rishikesh is a tehsil located in Uttarakhandâ€™s Tehri Garhwal region right on the banks of the holiest of Indian rivers, the Ganges. This ancient city has several mythological and religious legends associated with Lord Vishnu, Lord Bharat, and various prominent sages and is said to have been established in the 9th-century AD by Adi Shankaracharya.

    <p> Rishikesh is also known as Internation Yoga Capital.</p>
    <p>Rishikesh is also known for its connection with The Beatles. In February 1968, members of the legendary English rock band visited Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (now popularly known as the Beatles Ashram) to learn transcendental meditation. The band composed nearly 48 songs during their time at the Maharishi's ashram, many of which appear on the White Album (and a few from Abbey Road). John Lennon recorded a song titled, 'The Happy Rishikesh Song' after his visit. Several other international artists, including Mike Love of the Beach Boys, Paul Horn, Donovan and Gyp Mills, visited the site to contemplate and meditate.</p>
